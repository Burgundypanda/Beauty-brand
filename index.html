        <span class="trend">Glass Skin</span> is literally as its name suggests,
        skin that resembles glass. It means that it looks completely flawless,
        poreless, clear and translucent with not a blemish in sight. The
        complexion should look ridiculously radiant and decadently dewy, with a
        focus on hydration and glow-inducing products. <br /><br />
        The key trick to achieving "glass skin" is layering your skincare
        products. Sometimes we can be a little bit lazy and do a standard
        cleanse and moisturise job, but if you want to achieve "Gwang" (Korean
        for dewy glow), you're going to need to put some time and effort in. If
        you want to get "glass skin", you need to look a little deeper than
        surface level.
